# Tinder Clone

I built a basic frontend focued tinder clone with React and Firebase as my first taster of using react. Learning about components and how react apps are built. 

# How It's Made:
Tech used: CSS, REACT, JS, FIREBASE

+ React used to build the core app, utilising routes for different pages
+ Used material-ui for the logos and styling
+ CSS used to style individual elements

# Optimizations:
+ Full MERN app - I'd like to add more database commmuincation and functionality


# Lessons Learned:
+ How import and exporting components work
+ Setting up a firebase database
+ How router, routes and route works
